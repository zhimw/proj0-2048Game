# proj0-2048Game

This is project 0 from Berkeley CS 61B Spring 2021.

- To run the game, open the Main class and run it. You should see the game pop up. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the number tiles.
- I used the starter code given by the professor and created 4 methods in the Model.java file which governs what happens after certain key-presses from the user.
- The four methods I created are: emptySpaceExists, maxTileExists, atLeastOneMoveExists and tilt.
